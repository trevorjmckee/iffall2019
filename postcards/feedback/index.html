		<h2>Aesthetic</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>I really love the second design. It is simple, easy to read, and feels like it relates to the 'modernity' (excuse the pun) of the show.</li>
			<li>The same type of white space doesn't exist very clearly in the other images. I might try to source other images or intentionally blur portions of the images you have.</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Structure</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>The lowered opacity on the quotation marks set up a consistent hierarchy focused on the actual text.</li>
			<li>The orange line in desktop both relates to the image and helps to frame the quote on such a big screen. I like that you take it out for mobile.</li>
			<li>I would make the text scale depending on the size of the browser window. You'll have to be careful that it isn't so big that it overlaps with the image of the person.</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Technical challenges</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>You can probably get away with keeping the same design strategy for desktop and tablet. As soon as we get into the realm of mobile phones, however, you'll probably want to switch over the type to overlay the image intentionally.</li>
			<li>Images seem to be well-sourced. I only worry about the resolution of the third image at a desktop scale. I would just double check that it is large enough for a big screen! :)</li>
		</ul>
